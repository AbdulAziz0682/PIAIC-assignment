		</ul>
		<div>
			<h1 id="cnc">Cloud Native Computing</h1>
			<p>
				The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open source
				technologies like, <b><i>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</i></b>
				while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
				techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
			</p>

		<div>
			<h1 id="ai">Artificial Intelligence</h1>
			<p>
				The <b>artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
				technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <b><i>Python, Numpy, Pandas,
				Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</i></b>, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
				ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1 id="bc">Blockchain</h1>
			<p>
				The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like <b><i>Ethereum
				and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on
				frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
				(DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-
				service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1 id="iot">Internet of Things</h1>
			<p>
				The <b>Internet of things</b> program introduces the students to open source development
				technologies like <b><i>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
				and Kubernetes</i></b> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
				Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
